# crypto-equality

A very small Clojure library for protecting against
[timing attacks][1] when comparing strings or sequences of bytes.

This is useful for comparing user-supplied values against secrets held
by the application, such as tokens or keys.

## Installation

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj` file:

    [crypto-equality "1.0.0"]

## Usage

Require the `crypto.equality` namespace:

```clojure
(require '[crypto.equality :as crypto])
```

Then use the `eq?` function to compare strings, byte arrays, or any
ordered sequence of integers.

```clojure
(crypto/eq? "foo" "foo") ;; => true
(crypto/eq? "foo" "bar") ;; => false
```
